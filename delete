Write a Prolog program to implement delete_nth (N, L, R) that removes the element on Nth
position from a list L to generate a list R.
Solution 
delete_nth(1, [H|T], T):- !.
delete_nth(N, [H|T], [H|T1]):-
 N1 is N - 1,
 delete_nth(N1, T, T1).

Output 
| ?- delete_nth(2,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6],X).
X = [0,2,3,4,5,6]
yes
| ?- delete_nth(10,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6],X).
no
| ?-
