Write a Prolog program to implement two predicates evenlength(List) and oddlength(List) so that
they are true if their argument is a list of even or odd length respectively.
Solution 
evenlength([]):- !.
evenlength([_|L]):- oddlength(L).
oddlength([_]):- !.
oddlength([_|L]):- evenlength(L).

Output 
| ?- evenlength([7,89,3,2,0]).
no
| ?- oddlength([7,89,3,2,0]).
yes
| ?-
